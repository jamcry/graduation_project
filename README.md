# graduation_project
Graduation project about **RFID based electronic voting system using Arduino**.
This project consists of two source files: a Python script *(.py)* and a Arduino script *(.ino)*.

In this project an RFID based electronic voting system which uses the RFID techonology to
identify the voters is designed and constructed. The project can be divided to 2 parts which are
computer side and controller side. The main computer stores all the data related to voting and the
voters, and provides a GUI that shows voterâ€™s name, photo and eligibility to vote. On the
controller side, which is the electronic voting circuit, microcontroller (Arduino) gets the data and
sends to the computer via serial. This project also has capability to handle a number of people
voting simultaneously.
